# Analog-QEC-GKP
Ananlog Quantum Error Correction Using GKP Codes

Did a complete literary review on Quantum Error Correction in general and also with GKP codes. Most of the current research is done using infinitely squeezed GKP codes. I worked on the behaviour of finitely squeezed GKP codes as these are practically realisable. I studied the analog information contained in these codes in both ideal & non-ideal cases. Now, I am working on ways to concatenate non-ideal GKP codes with other discrete variable codes where the analog information contained in GKP codes can be used in iterative decoding algorithms to improve noise threshold.
